# Text-Extraction-using-Doctr
=======
This project is a straightforward text extraction tool from documents, leveraging the powerful doctr library. doctr is a robust, efficient, and accessible OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library, based on cutting-edge Deep Learning techniques. The project's repository can be found at https://github.com/mindee/doctr.

In addition to the OCR capabilities, the project also includes a user-friendly interface created using Selenium. This interface enables users to interact with the tool seamlessly.

To run the project, Docker is used along with the provided Dockerfile and requirements.txt file. Follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image using: docker build -t <image_name> .
